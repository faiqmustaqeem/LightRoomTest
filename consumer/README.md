# Android Engine Consumer

You can build project from CLI using `./gradlew build` or open Android Studio if you need that.

In Android Studio if you try to run and see edit configuration dialog then
go to `File -> Project Structure -> App` choose already choosen `Build Tools Version` 
(Yes that's strange), tap ok and then try to run again.
